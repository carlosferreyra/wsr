//! Command-line interface definitions for wsr.
//!
//! This crate owns all clap-specific code: the top-level [`Cli`] struct, every
//! subcommand enum, and all argument types. It is a library — it contains no
//! `main` function and no side effects.
//!
//! The binary entry point (`crates/wsr/src/bin/wsr.rs`) depends on this crate
//! to parse `std::env::args()`, then hands the structured result to
//! `crates/wsr/src/commands/` for dispatch.
//!
//! # Why separate from the binary?
//!
//! Keeping clap definitions in a standalone library lets other tools (shell
//! completion generators, man-page renderers, test harnesses) import the CLI
//! schema without pulling in the full binary dependency graph.
